        <p className="mb-4">
          I'm a passionate junior full-stack developer with expertise in building exceptional digital experiences. 
          I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited about the challenges and opportunities ahead.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy taking on complex 
          challenges and turning them into simple, beautiful solutions.
          I can write low code and no code solutions to deliver  the best outcome with a shorter time to market for your business.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some tech reviews on Youtube, or if the weather's good, play Sepak Takraw with my friends!
